# React timeseries charts library

A react-based library to display timeseries data, inspired by [react-timeseries-charts](http://software.es.net/react-timeseries-charts/#/), but using a different foundation. The goals of the project are:
- function based components and hooks
- keep the same basic layout (container, multiple rows, multiple vertical axes)
- remove obsolete external dependencies (no pond) or refresh them (d3-*)
- support both aligned and unaligned timeseries
- do not overly transform the component tree to keep intuitive mapping between declared and rendered components
- strip un-necessary concepts (brush & co) and move them to chart types
- provide well-defined extensibility API for charts, horizontal and vertical axes
- provide plugable data sources with a built-in [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) datasource
